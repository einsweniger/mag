# microsoft academic graph

This repo contains scripts to work with microsoft academic graph 

As starting point, it focuses on uploading in a database the datasets released on zenodo by **david schmid**

https://github.com/einsweniger

the dataset is available here: 
https://zenodo.org/record/2628216#.XLH6mkOxXM0

The folders *mag_postgresql* and *mag_sqlite* includes scripts to create tables ad imprt data for postgresql and sqlite3 respectively. 

**N.B:** 

- uploading in postgres does not work for the moment due to data formating issues

- sqlite scripts work but require some pre-processing of the data
